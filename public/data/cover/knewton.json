We need the scalability of digital educational systems. Even without population growth, only  about 40% of the world population has access to internet. As this moves towards 100%, there will be an inevitable increase in demand for digital educational resources.\n"

They all suffer from the common problem of snapshotting through a keyhole. Each assessment captures only a very narrow moment in time, through a very narrow window of data. The future of job placement and advancement is likely to be educational systems that gather rich longitudinal data."
