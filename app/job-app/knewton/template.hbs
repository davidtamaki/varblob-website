            title="Digital education is the future of education"}}
            With estimates of the world population growing by another two billion in Asia and Africa by 2050, there is simply not enough educational infrastructure to provide education to everyone. We need the scalability of digital educational systems. Even without population growth, only  about 40% of the world population has access to internet. As this moves towards 100%, there will be an inevitable increase in demand for digital educational resources.

            I did a fair amount of stats work at ConnectCubed when designing and analyzing performance and hiring statistics for our clients. At HitPoint studios, I built and was in charge of a tracking system for our games. As a project manager and game designer, I would use these tools to optimize micro transactions or client specified desired user interactions for ad games.

            I co-founded a company and ran it for 4 years. I was also one of the first hires at HitPoint Studios.  I've pulled an all nighter after a 24 hour flight from Hong Kong and a 6 hour bus ride from the airport to the office because we needed to get things done.

          {{#collapse-card isCollapsed=true
            title="I have deep insight into hiring and performance assessment practices"}}
          ConnectCubed, the startup I co-founded, was focused on human resources, specifically performance, hiring, and analytics. The reality is pretty bleak; the current tools for predicting employee success (personality, aptitude, interviews, grades, skills, etc.) are simply not that good at predicting. They all suffer from the common problem of snapshotting through a keyhole. Each assessment captures only a very narrow moment in time, through a very narrow window of data. The future of job placement and advancement is likely to be educational systems that gather rich longitudinal data.

          {{#collapse-card isCollapsed=true
            title="I understand the power of game mechanics and want to use it for good"}}
          I left my job at HitPoint Studios because I saw the power of game mechanics and didn't want to apply it to ad games. I wanted to utilize the power of games and game mechanics to contribute to society. I still believe this is possible, and I think that knowledge of game mechanics, even if expressed subtly, is extremely helpful for any product, but especially in education.
