            Using the accelerometer to generate sound is a good start to body movements creating music but the dance movements allowed are too rigid to give a dancer enough freedom of expression in their movements.  I also want to move the control of individual button presses to the ensemble level as opposed to the individual level.
    challenges:
      - problem: How to give dancers enough freedom of movement whilst also having enough control to generate improvised music.
